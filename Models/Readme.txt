Below you'll find the original copyright information for this model.  

To adapt this model for use in FlightGear I have converted it from MDL to AC3D format
using the threedconvert utility provided by FlightGear.  The *AF graphics were first
converted to BMP using Kai Wang-Erlandsen's FS98 Texture Converter 0.1, then to RGB
(also known as SGI) format using The GIMP.  After the mesh is converted to AC3D format 
the surfaces are all individual objects, so they need to be regrouped into a few 
objects and named.  Textures are remapped where needed.  The fuselage texture was 
created by adding the seperate  256x256 textures into one 256x1024 texture and re-
mapping the fuselage.  Animations were added in XML.  An afterburner plume was added. 
A 3D cockpit was added, using instruments borrowed from the existing F-80C model.
